// Agent z_one in project Zeuthen Strategy.mas2j

// z_one is similar to z_two, and in fact, mostly copied and pasted (including this very text!). There is one important difference:
// A deal, defined as [[list], [list]], consists of two task allocations, one for each agent.
// Z_one uses the LEFT list as its set, and the right list as Z_two's. You are free to define a deal in other ways, however.
// Depending on how you implement the Zeuthen strategy, you might end up adding functionalities to one agent and not to the other.
// Always make sure that when you copy and paste code from one agent to the other, that you make the necessary adjustments (such as
// switching which side the agent has to use).

// Hint: Jason is not widely used on the internet, so code examples mostly exist
// on the Jason site itself. However, the beliefs are mostly prolog: take examples
// from prolog code, then check on http:// jason.sourceforge.net/api/ if their prolog
// equivalents exist.
// Further, you should not need to use the environment/java part of this code.
// You should be able to finish all assignments by adjusting z_one and z_two.

// I remember where the post office is.

// I remember the following routes and their cost:
// Unless you want to make a graph search algorithm (not recommended),
// these beliefs will likely be unused.

route(b, c, 4).
route(b, d, 6).
route(b, e, 5).

// I know the costs of all sub-tasks. Keep in mind that every possible combination
// is written here: if you want to add more, you will have to write down all
// new possible costs.
// It is recommended to keep lists in alphabetic order. Jason does not see
// [b, c] as the same as [c, b]. This can cause bugs. If necessary, use the function
// .sort(List, SortedList) to make a list[c, b] a sorted list [b, c].
